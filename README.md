# Using Docker/Docker Compose

I've included both files to make this process simple. Highly recommend using docker compose for production.

## change {appname} to what you want the image to be named

### To use docker only, run these commands
- docker build --pull --rm -f 'Dockerfile' -t '{appname}:latest' '.' 
- docker run --rm -d --env-file {appname}:latest
### To use docker compose, this is the only command you need
- docker compose -f 'docker-compose.yml' up -d --build
    - optionally you can replace `-d` with `-it` to watch the logs
## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it using the following commands:

- **Systems:** `/system enable [system] [channel]` - Enable systems to start using the bot.
- **Giveaways:** `/giveaway create [prize] [winners] [duration]` - Start a new giveaway.
- **Tickets:** `Just click the button in the channel you enable the ticket system in.` - Create a new support ticket.
- **Self Roles:** `**coming soon**` - Assign a role to yourself.
- **Counting:** `**coming soon**` - Participate in the counting game.
